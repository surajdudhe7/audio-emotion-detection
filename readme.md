# Real-Time Audio Emotion Detection

This project is a Flask-based web application that records user audio, predicts the emotion expressed in the recording, and stores the data (including probabilities for each emotion) in an SQLite database. It uses **librosa** for feature extraction and a pre-trained machine learning model for emotion classification.

## Features
- **Real-Time Audio Recording**: Record audio through the app interface.
- **Emotion Prediction**: Classify the emotion of the recorded audio into categories like `neutral`, `happy`, `sad`, etc.
- **Database Storage**: Save audio recordings and their predicted emotions in an SQLite database.
- **Probabilities for Each Emotion**: Get the probability for each emotion along with the predicted emotion.
- **Audio Retrieval**: Retrieve stored audio from the database and reanalyze it.
